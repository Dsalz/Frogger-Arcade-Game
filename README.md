## About
 This is a fun spin on the popular frogger game coded by me as part of the projects in the front-end nanodegree program at udacity. Hope you enjoy!
 
## How to Play
- http://dsalz.github.io/Frogger-Arcade-Game/ is where the game is hosted
- You can fork this repository to play the game locally.
- The aim of the game is to cross without getting hit by the nefarious roaches
- For each hit you lose a life
- For each succesful cross you get 5 points
- Collect gems across the way for extra points
- My high score is 6,835 (Beat That! :) )
- HAVE FUN!
